# Third-party references and attribution

Pangram and Open Pangram are names of Pangram Labs. This independent private workspace is not affiliated with Pangram and does not claim to reproduce its proprietary models, accuracy, plagiarism index, or commercial integrations.

The requested model is [pangram/editlens_Llama-3.2-3B](https://huggingface.co/pangram/editlens_Llama-3.2-3B). Its model card specifies **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, English, and the Meta Llama 3.2 3B base. The adapter and base have separate gated access requirements.

`backend/pangram_backend/providers/preprocess.py` adapts the preprocessing behavior published in [Pangram Labs/EditLens](https://github.com/pangramlabs/EditLens/blob/main/scripts/preprocess.py), adding original-text offset mappings. `providers/editlens.py` adapts its NormedLinear architecture and expected-bucket score from [train.py](https://github.com/pangramlabs/EditLens/blob/main/scripts/train.py) and [inference.py](https://github.com/pangramlabs/EditLens/blob/main/scripts/inference.py), adding lazy loading, CPU/MPS support, and chunking. The upstream work and these adaptations are subject to [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Other backend files are original workspace implementation; no commercial rights to Pangram's models are implied.

The interface was informed by the user's signed-in Pangram dashboard and the public [Pangram site](https://www.pangram.com/). No paid plan was purchased. No private account history or user documents were imported into this workspace.

Visual reference assets in `app/public/reference/` (headline, wordmark, fox and dashboard backgrounds) are copied from publicly served Pangram assets for this requested private replica.

The active merged Qwen checkpoint is [DarrenJiaImbue/editlens-qwen3-4b-merged-v3](https://huggingface.co/DarrenJiaImbue/editlens-qwen3-4b-merged-v3), CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, revision `33716e3667e3514a92cd1e9a6f1511655f12ef86`. `providers/qwen.py` adapts the original EditLens NormedLinear head and this model card’s loading instructions. See `research/README.md` for dataset attribution and limitations.


MELD v5 uses the MIT-licensed checkpoint and reference scorer from
[anon-review-meld-2026/meld](https://huggingface.co/anon-review-meld-2026/meld), revision
`453acf594d48f8c55c3a38bde396f9178516d817`. `providers/meld_model.py` adapts that scorer
with strict loading and token evidence output. The localization and window stitching
are workspace additions. The downloaded model card is retained beside the checkpoint.

Reviewed architecture and input format adapted from [NandhaKishorM/laya v0.3.20](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/tree/v0.3.20), developed by Convai Innovations. License retained at `docs/licenses/laya-Apache-2.0.txt`. Local modifications add targeted phrase inputs, bounded paragraph context, portable strict weight loading, and native MLX inference with marker-only final-layer queries. No upstream model Python files are executed. This is an experimental zero-shot baseline, not a validated AI-authorship detector.

# OpenReview Paper Downloader

Simple download, listing, and search of oral, spotlight, accepted, or rejected papers from OpenReview into tidy folders by decision.

Despite the name, this works for **any** OpenReview-hosted conference (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.).

## Installation

```bash
pip install openreview_downloader
```

## Usage

The CLI saves PDFs into `downloads/<venue>/<decision>/` with sanitized filenames.

**Available decisions:**
- `oral` – Oral presentations
- `spotlight` – Spotlight presentations
- `accepted` – All accepted papers
- `rejected` – Rejected papers
- `all` – Accepted and rejected papers

### Authentication

Some OpenReview venues require authenticated API access. If `OPENREVIEW_USERNAME` and `OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD` are present in the environment, the CLI uses them automatically and does not prompt.

To save credentials for future runs:

```bash
ordl auth
```

You can also check or clear saved credentials:

```bash
ordl auth status
ordl auth logout
```

When no environment or saved credentials are available, `ordl` asks for your OpenReview email and password interactively before contacting OpenReview.

### Latest ICML example (2026)

OpenReview may require authenticated API access for ICML 2026. Run `ordl auth` once, or set `OPENREVIEW_USERNAME` and `OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD` in your environment.

Download all ICML 2026 spotlight papers:

```bash
ordl spotlight --venue-id ICML.cc/2026/Conference
```

Download Output:

```

List accepted and rejected papers:

```bash
ordl all --list --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference

```

If you omit `DECISIONS` while listing or searching, the CLI defaults to accepted papers and exits without downloading:

```bash
ordl --head 20 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

### Search, grep, and regex workflows

Search over title, authors, abstract, keywords, decision, venue, id, and paper number. `--search` and `--grep` are aliases; matching is case-insensitive by default.

Preview accepted papers matching a text query:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --search diffusion --head 2 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Example output:

```

  match: title / diffusion: KLASS: KL-Guided Fast Inference in Masked [Diffusion] Models
```

Preview regex matches and show snippets plus counts:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --regex 'diffusion|transformer' --head 2 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download the same selection by rerunning the same query without `--list`:

```bash
ordl accepted --search diffusion --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Download only the first 10 matches:

```bash
ordl accepted --search diffusion --head 10 --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

Require multiple terms or patterns by repeating the flags:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --grep diffusion --grep protein --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

For scripts, agents, and crawlbots, use JSON Lines output while listing:

```bash
ordl accepted --list --search diffusion --head 2 --format jsonl --venue-id NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference
```

The first JSON line is a summary with the number of matched and shown papers; each following line is one paper record with stable fields such as `id`, `number`, `decision`, `title`, `authors`, `pdf_path`, `match_count`, and `matches`.

JSONL keeps progress logs on stderr so stdout can be piped directly into tools:

```json
{"decisions": ["accepted"], "head": 2, "matched_papers": 710, "shown_papers": 2, "type": "summary", "venue_id": "NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"}
{"authors": "Jiyao Zhang, Zhiyuan Ma, Tianhao Wu, Zeyuan Chen, Hao Dong", "decision": "accepted", "id": "CB8jwNE2vV", "match_count": 1, "matches": [{"count": 1, "field": "abstract", "query": "diffusion", "snippet": "... high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-[diffusion] model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closu..."}], "number": 29119, "pdf_path": "downloads/neurips2025/accepted/29119_CADGrasp_Learning_Contact_and_Collision_Aware_General_Dexterous_Grasping_in_Cluttered_Scenes.pdf", "title": "CADGrasp: Learning Contact and Collision Aware General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes", "type": "paper", "venue": "NeurIPS 2025 poster", "venueid": "NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"}
```

### Other Conferences (ICLR, ICML, etc.)

Just change the `--venue-id` to the appropriate OpenReview handle.

**ICLR 2025 orals only:**

```bash
ordl oral --venue-id ICLR.cc/2025/Conference
```

**ICLR 2025 accepted papers (all formats):**

```bash
ordl accepted --venue-id ICLR.cc/2025/Conference
```

**ICML 2025 oral + spotlight:**

```bash
ordl oral,spotlight --venue-id ICML.cc/2025/Conference
```

You can use any other OpenReview venue ID in the same way.


### CLI Options

- **`DECISIONS`** (positional) – Comma-separated list of decisions to select (`oral`, `spotlight`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `all`)
- **`--venue-id`** – OpenReview venue ID (default: `NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference` or env `VENUE_ID`)
- **`--out-dir`** – Custom output directory (default: `downloads/<venue>/`)
- **`--no-skip-existing`** – Re-download even if the PDF is already present
- **`--info`** – Print decision counts for the venue and exit
- **`--list`** – List selected papers and exit without downloading
- **`--head N`** – Limit the selection to the first `N` papers; useful for previews or small downloads
- **`--search TEXT` / `--grep TEXT`** – Text search across paper metadata; repeat to require multiple terms
- **`--regex PATTERN`** – Regex search across paper metadata; repeat to require multiple patterns
- **`--case-sensitive`** – Make search and regex matching case-sensitive
- **`--format text|jsonl`** – Output format for `--list`; `jsonl` is convenient for automation
- **`--with-abstract`** – Include abstract and TLDR in `--list` output
- **`--max-filename-words N`** – Maximum number of title words to keep in downloaded PDF filenames; extra words are dropped (default: `5`)
- **`ordl auth`** – Save OpenReview credentials for future runs
- **`ordl auth status`** – Show whether credentials come from the environment, saved auth, or neither
- **`ordl auth logout`** – Remove saved OpenReview credentials

## Local batch-download enhancement

This Pangram copy defaults to `--batch-size 50` (valid range 1–50). Use
`--batch-size 1` for the original individual-request behavior. Each batch uses
OpenReview's `get_attachment(field_name="pdf", ids=[...])` endpoint. ZIP entries
are matched by submission number, not archive order or title. Incomplete,
duplicate, unexpected, or non-PDF entries reject the batch before saving PDFs.
Completed files are written atomically. A challenge or rate-limit response stops
the run without automatic retries; other failed batches are reported with a
nonzero exit status. Existing selection and skip-existing behavior is retained.

Batch quotas must be measured separately: 140 successful individual requests
per hour does not establish the cost or quota for a 50-paper request.

Upstream source: mireklzicar/openreview_downloader, commit
`e55a0461677f5dc0a1512fce60a964e79c01f668`. This is a local modified copy.

## Persistent ReviewBench queue

Run the prepared queue without editing the script:

```bash
/tmp/openreview-benchmark-venv/bin/python /Users/alicerigg/codex-projects/pangram/research/tools/openreview_downloader/run_queue.py --max-batches 138 --stop-at-limit
```

Login is prompted locally and credentials are not saved. The queue visits years
oldest first, and conferences alphabetically within each year, taking up to 50
pending papers per group per pass. After the newest year it starts another pass.
Exhausted groups are skipped; unresolved years are held aside.
Only verified API 2 venues participate. API 1 venues are held as `held_legacy`
because their documented attachment API only accepts a single paper ID.
Venue versions were checked using API 2 group metadata (`domain`) and are
recorded in `venue-api-versions.json`; the prepared plan includes each version.

State and the running tally live in `research/data/reviewbench_download_queue/`.
PDFs are organized in `pdfs/<conference>/<year>/`. Successful papers are skipped
on subsequent runs. Interrupted requests with a saved complete response recover
locally; ambiguous requests are held for inspection rather than automatically
requested again. A process lock prevents concurrent queue runners.

Use `--status` instead of the download flags to inspect progress without login.
The authenticated 50-PDF test on 2026-09-24 consumed one quota unit; the response
advertised 140 requests per 3,600 seconds. This is an observed endpoint policy,
not a guarantee of future limits. `--stop-at-limit` prevents waiting into a new
quota window.

[Open the interactive table of all samples and columns](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-text-detector/pangram-paper-text/viewer/default/train). Sign in with your organization account. The Dataset Viewer lets you browse records and inspect each column; Parquet is the underlying storage format and does not require downloading files to browse the table.

## Provenance and use

The Parquet file is byte-identical to the source release at revision `a79fcf1ffcb45a20bf6c9728142d0fa974304e95`; SHA256: `2fb3ec7e1139808c0f3eea300d8f1a3d78b9e0ee11291ead7bdf020d6dbf1fcf`.

`train` contains the full corpus and is a storage convention, not a curated train/evaluation split. Paper text is not labeled as human-only authorship. PDF/text hashes identify exact versions; metadata records extraction methods and caveats. PDFs, position rectangles and classifier predictions are excluded. Pin a dataset commit for reproducible runs.
